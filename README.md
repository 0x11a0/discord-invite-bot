## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Discord Bot Token
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-invite-bot.git
   cd discord-invite-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create the Bot:**
    Create the bot here: [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)  

4. **Add Bot to your Server:**
    Ensure the Bot is Invited to a Guild:

    - Make sure your bot has been invited to at least one Discord server (guild). You can generate an invite link from the Discord Developer Portal.
    
    - To generate the invite link, you can use the following URL format, replacing CLIENT_ID with your botâ€™s client ID:
    
    > https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8


5. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following variables:
   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   CHANNEL_PREFIX=channel-
   ```
6. **Start the Bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Docker (Optional):**
   If you prefer to run the bot in a Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t discord-invite-bot .
   docker run -d --env-file .env discord-invite-bot
   ```

## Architecture

The architecture of the **discord-invite-bot** is designed to securely interact with Discord, create channels, and manage user invites based on various configurable criteria.

### Components:
1. **Discord Bot:**
   - Interacts with the Discord API to create private channels, generate invite links, and perform user verification.
   
2. **API Server:**
   - Serves as the middleware between the frontend and the Discord Bot, ensuring secure communication and data validation.
   
3. **Frontend (Optional):**
   - Provides an interface for users to trigger channel creation and handle submissions.
